# Hangman-A-Game
A Game Build on the JACK Language to be run on the VM-Emulator as a part of the nand2tetris course

Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing 
word by guessing one letter at a time. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game 
ends and the player will lose the game. The game also ends if the player has correctly 
identified all the letters of the missing word.
In this Implementation we intend to make this a multiplayer game, where one person can 
give the word to be guessed along with a hint for that word, and the other player has to Guess 
the word using the hint Provided in the given number of attempts.
